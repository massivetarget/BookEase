Title: Fix React Native/Expo Build Configuration (30-60 min task)

Description:
I have a complete React Native bookkeeping app built with Expo SDK 54 and Realm database. 
All code is written and functional, but I need help getting it to build successfully.

Current Issue:
- EAS Build failing at Gradle phase
- React Native version conflicts
- Need either local Android Studio setup or EAS Build fix

What You'll Do:
- Review build logs and identify issue
- Fix dependency/version conflicts
- Get a working APK or local build running

Requirements:
- Experience with Expo SDK 54
- Experience with Realm database
- Experience with EAS Build or Android Studio
- Can work remotely (all code is documented)

Deliverables:
- Working APK file OR local build instructions
- Brief documentation of what was fixed

Budget: $50-150 (fixed price for completion)
Timeline: ASAP (should take 30-60 minutes for experienced developer)
