# BookEase: Privacy-First Bookkeeping App - Complete Project Blueprint

### Overview
This document summarizes the entire discussion on designing and building a cross-platform bookkeeping application called **BookEase**. The app focuses on **privacy-first** principles: local data storage, no cloud dependency for core operations, peer-to-peer sync, and encrypted backups. It's designed for small businesses or personal accounting, with potential for future ML integration (e.g., fraud detection).

**Key Goals:**
- Run natively on Android, iOS, Mac, and Windows.
- Offline-first: All data local, sync only when devices connect.
- Professional feel: Reports, charts, audit logs, dark mode.
- No server required: Purely device-based, with optional Google Drive backups.

**Project Status:** Blueprint complete. Next steps: Initialize project and start coding.

## Technology Stack
| Component | Choice | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| **Framework** | React Native + Expo + TypeScript | Cross-platform (mobile, desktop, web-view only). TypeScript for type-safety. Expo for easy builds without heavy SDKs (no Android Studio/Xcode needed during dev). |
| **Database** | Realm | Local, object-oriented, fast (3-4x SQLite). Supports encryption, background sync, and ML data export. JSON bridging for sync/backups. |
| **Authentication** | Expo SecureStore + Biometrics (Face/Touch ID) or 6-digit PIN | Local-only login. No server auth. |
| **Sync Mechanism** | Peer-to-Peer via QR scan or Bluetooth | Devices connect directly; export/import encrypted JSON. Auto-merge conflicts (latest timestamp wins). |
| **Backup/Restore** | Encrypted .zip export to Google Drive | Use Expo + Google Signin. Auto-upload optional. Restore via file picker + PIN. File naming: `backup-[UUID].zip`. |
| **UI/UX Libraries** | Recharts/Victory (charts), react-native-pdf (exports), Expo Appearance (dark/light mode) | Professional reports (P&L, cash flow). Accessibility labels for all elements. |
| **Other Tools** | Expo CLI for dev/builds; Expo Go app for live testing | Cloud builds via EAS (no local heavy installs). Web build for view-only access (not full edits). |

**Setup Commands:**
```bash
npx create-react-native-app BookEase --template typescript
cd BookEase
expo start  # QR scan with Expo Go on phone for live preview
```

## Core Features
1. **Login Screen**
   - PIN or biometrics unlock.
   - Guest mode for quick views (read-only).

2. **Dashboard**
   - Total balance, today's cash flow.
   - Quick add transaction button.

3. **Transaction Management**
   - List view: Add/Edit/Delete entries.
   - Fields: Amount, Date, Category, Note, Type (Debit: red icon, Credit: green icon).
   - Realm schema example:
     ```typescript
     class Transaction {
       amount: number;
       date: Date;
       category: string;
       note: string;
       type: 'debit' | 'credit';
     }
     ```

4. **Reporting & Analytics**
   - P&L charts (monthly/yearly) using Recharts.
   - Date range picker.
   - PDF export for statements (via expo-print).
   - Future ML: Analyze patterns for fraud alerts (TensorFlow.js on Realm data).

5. **Audit Log**
   - Separate Realm model: `{ action: 'add/edit/delete', itemId: string, user: string, timestamp: Date }`.
   - History tab to track changes.

6. **Settings**
   - Theme toggle (dark/light, auto-detect).
   - Backup/Restore buttons.
   - Sync device pairing.

7. **Professional Touches**
   - Logo/header: "BookEase" in bold font.
   - Persistent balance footer.
   - Accessibility: `accessible={true}` on all interactive elements.
   - Multi-user: Separate PINs per user, merge on sync.

## Sync & Data Flow
- **Local Storage:** Realm handles all CRUD operations offline.
- **Sync Process:**
  1. Devices on same network/Bluetooth: Scan QR or enter code.
  2. Export Realm to encrypted JSON (`realm.write(() => { /* export */ })`).
  3. Transfer via Bluetooth/QR/email.
  4. Import on target: Decrypt, merge into Realm (resolve conflicts by timestamp).
- **No Auto-Sync:** Manual trigger for privacy.
- **Web Access:** Limited to view-only via Expo web build (uses IndexedDB, not full Realm).

## Backup Strategy
- **Export:** Button triggers Realm → Encrypted ZIP (using crypto libs).
- **Storage:** Upload to Google Drive (Expo integration: `expo install @react-native-google-signin/google-signin`).
- **Restore:** Pick file from Drive, enter PIN, overwrite/merge Realm.
- **Frequency:** Optional auto-backup nightly.
- **Security:** All files PIN-encrypted; no plaintext on Drive.

## Potential Challenges & Solutions
| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| **Build for iOS/Mac** | Expo cloud builds; Mac + Xcode only for final App Store (free dev account). |
| **Heavy Installs** | Expo avoids Android Studio (7-8GB); use Expo Go for testing. |
| **Conflicts in Sync** | Auto-resolve: Keep latest entry; manual review option. |
| **ML Integration** | Realm objects feed directly to TensorFlow.js; train on exported JSON. |
| **File Size** | Clean old logs yearly; Realm is compact for bookkeeping. |

## Next Steps
1. **Initialize Project:** Run setup commands above.
2. **First Code:** Build login screen → Dashboard skeleton.
3. **Testing:** Expo Go on phone; add Realm schema.
4. **Iterations:** Add transactions → Sync prototype → Backups.
5. **Future Enhancements:** Full ML module, multi-currency, invoice scanning.
